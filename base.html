                        Some years ago I was struggling to grasp the concepts of Closures in javascript, so obviously
                        like any self-respecting developer I went to the
                        <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a>. It is there that I've found this
                        <b>GEM</b> that I want to share with you.

                    <p>
                        The topic of closures in javascript is one of those things that confuses most developers not
                        familiar with either the language or the topic itself. Seeing as how most developers now-a-days
                        actually meet this concept for the first time within the javascript, this doubles down on the
                        issue. So, I have, like many before me, went down that road and on the road to discover found
                        plent of answers, none of which
                        <span class="emphasize">made any sense whatsoever!</span>

                        In programming languages, a closure, also lexical closure or function closure, is a technique
                        for implementing lexically scoped name binding in a language with first-class functions.
                        Operationally, a closure is a record storing a function together with an environment. The
                        environment is a mapping associating each free variable of the function (variables that are used
                        locally, but defined in an enclosing scope) with the value or reference to which the name was
                        bound when the closure was created. Unlike a plain function, a closure allows the function to
                        access those captured variables through the closure's copies of their values or references, even
                        when the function is invoked outside their scope.

                        I mean, just look at that definition, how is a junior developer to understand that?

                        How is any novice programmer to understand that? Half the words mean nothing to someone without
                        deep knowledge of programing concepts. This is one of the main reasons, or at least I view it as
                        such, why we find dirty and ugly code in the wilds today. People are not explained the proper
                        concepts from the start.

                        So let me ask you do you want to see how a proper explenation looks like for someone who doesn't
                        understand things?
